This is a Api [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project,using [`@django-rest-framework`](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Chatting App React Native - Environment Setup](https://github.com/SamsuSidqy/Chatting-App-React-Native)step, 

## Step 1: Install Package

**"This Package"**
1. django
2. django-cors-headers 
3. django-oauth-toolkit
4. channels (For Package Channels, read the Channel installation documentation [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html))

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# Install Package
pip install <Name Package>

```

## Step 2: Start your Application

>**Note**: So that api and sockets or channels can run and be used on React Native. Do this, and access using your computer's IP, and make sure you are on the same network

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Run Localhost

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```
